I recently opened Pale Fire for the first time since High School. All I can say is: wow. Just. wow. Once I got over the natural aversion to the book that was built up by the insane attempts of my English teacher to get me to read it in high school, part of her ongoing campaign to stomp the love of reading from my fragile young mind, I realized how good it really was. Instead all the asinine "subtext" my teacher was constantly prattling on mindlessly about I found, upon my return Разливное пиво/ Сидр 0,56 / 0,25 . Guinness 390 / 250. Kilkenny 390 / 250.

I always wanted to re-visit Nabakov, and it seems like "Pale Fire" was highly regarded. I'm about 50% of the way through, and I'm losing the will to go on. I've pretty much surmised that the narrator is highly unreliable. It's kind of interesting that he seems to make every line of the poem somehow about himself. But my mind keeps wandering.

"There is a very loud amusement park right in front of my present lodging." What a rollercoaster this book is. I was confused at the foreword, entranced by the 999 line poem and annoyed at the commentaries. I read the whole thing linear, and there were parts I forced myself through because it was dragging. I'm glad I forced myself on some parts because on the whole, this book is amazing. By the end, I went back to the foreword and finally understood what K was yapping about. Some lines finally. Pale Fire: Pale Fire, novel in English by Vladimir Nabokov, published in 1962. It consists of a long poem and a commentary on it by an insane pedant.

We are absurdly accustomed to the miracle of a few written signs being able to contain immortal imagery, involutions of thought, new worlds with live people, speaking, weeping, laughing. We take it for granted so simply that in a sense, by the very act of brutish routine acceptance, we undo the work of the ages, the history of the gradual elaboration of poetical description and construction, from the treeman to Browning, from the caveman to Keats.

I am about 250 pages into Nabokov's Pale Fire and I am absolutely floored by how deliciously absurd it is. It is at once comical, dark, and deeply profound. Despite the commentary section of the book (which makes up the majority) jumping from topic to topic with almost no rhyme or reason to it I found it an incredible read. On one hand it feels like the work of a madman, which was obviously Nabokov's intention. In the book Charles Kinbote, the fictional man who writes the foreword and the comme.

I am not a native speaker of the English language , but I know it well enough and haven't had problems reading other books , like the whole ''Ice and Fire'' saga , some Dickens or most recently , a quick enjoyable read on movie editing. Yet ''Pale Fire'' proves such a tough read for me for various reasons . Two of those reasons stem from a larger one . I know this may be intentional , because our main protagonist Kinbote perceives himself Pale Fire is the eleventh episode of Season Two and the thirty-third episode overall. Alex's mission to take down Gogol comes to a head as she infiltrates her childhood home and faces ghosts from her past.
