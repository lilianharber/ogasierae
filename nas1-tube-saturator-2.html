According to Wave Arts, the Saturation section of TS-2 now runs about. This is experimental. I'm not saying that its "right," that it "works in some cases," or that "I would do this when I master songs." I am interested in your opinions. amp#x200B; I know that most of you will basically jump at this, and say "absolutely not." I would probably mostly agree, but I am having second thoughts (rather, I am considering experimenting). I was basically considering trying different things within Bluecat's Patchwork. Namely, different types of saturation or harmonic.

Tube Saturator 2 is a super accurate circuit simulation of a tube pre-amp with analog EQ, which can be overdriven gently for warming effects, or cranked for fat distortion. For example, we have way too many saturation and delay options. Dynamic tube, saturator, pedal, overdrive. then simple delay, ping pong delay, filter delay, grain delay, echo. does anyone else think some of these should be consolidated into a single device with a few modes to switch between? When's the last time anyone used the Overdrive device. Wave Arts - Tube Saturator 2 2.03 VST, AAX x86 x64 05.2016 » Плагины для обработки звука » Скачать торрент :: RuTracker.org. Hi all, I would like to share a Tip with all of you that I found in a very old post on the Ableton forum. Recently I have been Mixing and Mastering for my new album, everything was perfectly aligned I pushed it through some mastering compression but when I put it next to a "professional" track I just couldn't compete with the levels and the overall clarity of the sound. So I started googling around and found this post on the Ableton forum: https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?t=40500 Tube Saturator Vintage is a free reissue of the original Tube Saturator.  Tube Saturator 2 is vastly more efficient, nearly identical in simulation accuracy, and adds other features. However, some users prefer the sound of the original and request. Hey all! I have an old Marshall valve guitar amp that I dropped all my savings on as a teenager when I was The Future Greatest Guitarist Ever. I'm pretty fond of it but I don't have much use for it these days. Then I realised it would be amazing to use as an outboard tube saturator for software synths. It has an emulated line-out and I'm able to record from that perfectly into my Duet interface, or else just mic up the speakers.

I have a soft spot for re-creating the past in my tracks. Ableton's built-in vinyl distortion and tube saturator are good starting points, but I'm looking for some stuff of higher quality. I'm also curious how people make their tracks sound like they are playing on old radios, such as the beginning of this: Obviously there is a low/bandpass filter in there, but it sounds like something else is going on. Thoughts. Tube Saturator 2 is a super accurate circuit simulation of a tube pre-amp with analog EQ, which can be overdriven gently for warming effects, or cranked for fat distortion. Like its predecessor, Tube Saturator, TS-2 is based on circuit simulation technology to capture every nuance of an analog. Logic user here fyi. So, I've read and digested tons of info about mastering ones own tunes over the last several months. I've read tutorials, interviews with producers, watched videos, etc, etc. Some are in the camp that mastering should be done by another set of ears after a quality mix has been achieved (mastering should accentuate an already solid mix.it should not change the tune drastically.) Others master as they go, applying the their effects chain on the master bus from the beginn.

I. INTRODUCTION The short version: In 2016, my band decided to track our first album. We were poor college students at the time (now poor college-grads) and all we had were the bare necessities -- one microphone, a basic home studio, and our instruments. We tracked it and mixed it ourselves. It took us three tries to get it right, but we managed to beg and borrow our way through the process -- our only necessary costs were mastering and distribution.\ It doesn’t sound like it was tracked. Tube Saturator 2 is vastly more efficient, nearly identical in simulation accuracy, and adds other features. However, some users prefer the sound of the original and request it, hence we have released https://youtu.be/K-iWkQ8sRL0?t=42 (https://youtu.be/K-iWkQ8sRL0?t=42) Also in another one of his here https://youtu.be/nbE0s0fQ4BU?t=28 (https://youtu.be/nbE0s0fQ4BU?t=28) Another crazy Mastadon tune, at least this time the sound is probably easier to get to. I can't seem to get my sound to sound as distorted and crazy. Despite throwing more than enough saturation, overdrive distortion etc. on it it hardly changes. OTT didn't even change it much. I'm currently trying with a square. Authentic tube emulation Note that TS-2 uses PACE for license management. An iLok2 can be used but is not required, TS-2 allows machine authorication. iLok1 is not supported.

I go to Icon Collective (and actually met VR at a Qampamp;amp;amp;A This is a rack I made a while ago, should open in Live 9 as well as 10. Ever need to crunch up a sound "just a little"? One way to do that is use a saturator, or a little bit crushing, or a little overdrive. This rack makes that faster and easier, and lets you blend in different amounts of effects which all provide additional crunch or harmonics. There's eight knobs, set to control eight different distortions from Ableton's stock library: \- Bitcrushing \- "Mech" (Overdrive
